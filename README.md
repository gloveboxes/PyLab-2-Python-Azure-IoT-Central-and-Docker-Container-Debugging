## PDF Lab Guide

You may find it easier to download and follow the PDF version of the **Raspberry Pi, Python, Azure IoT Central, and Docker Container Debugging** PyLab.

- [English Lab Guide](https://github.com/gloveboxes/PyLab-2-Python-Azure-IoT-Central-and-Docker-Container-Debugging/blob/master/README.pdf)
<!-- - [简体中文实验室指南](https://github.com/gloveboxes/PyLab-2-Python-Azure-IoT-Central-and-Docker-Container-Debugging/blob/master/PyLab-2-Raspberry-Pi-Azure-IoT-Central-and-Docker-Container-Debugging_Chinese.pdf) -->

## PyLab Content

- [PyLab 1: Raspberry Pi, Debugging a Python Internet of Things Application](https://gloveboxes.github.io/PyLab-1-Debugging-a-Python-Internet-of-Things-Application/)
- [PyLab 2: Raspberry Pi, Azure IoT Central, and Docker Container Debugging](https://gloveboxes.github.io/PyLab-2-Python-Azure-IoT-Central-and-Docker-Container-Debugging/)

## Introduction

In this hands-on lab, you will learn how to create a Python Internet of Things (IoT) application with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/?WT.mc_id=iot-0000-dglover). Run the application  in a Docker Container on a Raspberry Pi, read temperature, humidity, and air pressure telemetry from a sensor, and finally debug the application running in the Docker Container.

## PyLab Set Up

<!-- - [Single-User Set Up](https://github.com/gloveboxes/PyLab-0-Raspberry-Pi-Set-Up/tree/master/setup-singleuser/README.md)

This automated set up installs the required libraries, Docker, and builds the lab docker images.

![Raspberry Pi with SSD](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gloveboxes/PyLab-2-Python-Azure-IoT-Central-and-Docker-Container-Debugging/master/resources/rpi3aplus.png) -->

### Multi-User Set Up

[Multi-User Set Up](https://github.com/gloveboxes/PyLab-0-Raspberry-Pi-Set-Up/tree/master/setup-multiuser/README.md)

The Multi-user set up allows up to 20 users/students per Raspberry Pi 4 4GB. A USB3 SSD or fast Flash drive is required to support the disk IO requirements for this number of users. The installation script installs the lab content, and Docker. Builds the lab Docker Images, and sets up all the users.

<!-- ## CircuitPython

[CircuitPython](www.circuitpython.org), an [Adafruit](www.adafruit.com) initiative, is built on the amazing work of Damien George and the MicroPython community. CircuitPython adds hardware support for Microcontroller development and simplifies some aspects of MicroPython. MicroPython and by extension, CircuitPython implements version 3 of the Python language reference. So, your Python 3 skills are transferrable.

CircuitPython runs on over 60 **Microcontrollers** as well as the **Raspberry Pi**. This means you build applications that access GPIO hardware on a Raspberry Pi using CircuitPython libraries.

The advantage of running CircuitPython on the Raspberry Pi is that there are powerful Python debugging tools available. If you have ever tried debugging applications on a Microcontroller, then you will appreciate it can be painfully complex and slow. You resort to print statements, toggling the state of LEDs, and worst case, using specialized hardware.

With Raspberry Pi and CircuitPython, you build and debug on the Raspberry Pi, when it is all working you transfer the app to a CircuitPython Microcontroller. You need to ensure any libraries used are copied to the Microcontroller, and pin mappings are correct. But much much simpler!

This hands-on lab uses CircuitPython libraries for GPIO, I2C, and the BME280 Temperature/Pressure/Humidity sensor. The CircuitPython libraries are installed on the Raspberry Pi with pip3.

```bash
pip3 install adafruit-blinka adafruit-circuitpython-bme280
``` -->

## Software Installation

![set up requirements](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gloveboxes/PyLab-2-Python-Azure-IoT-Central-and-Docker-Container-Debugging/master/resources/setup.jpg)

This hands-on lab uses Visual Studio Code. Visual Studio Code is a code editor and is one of the most popular **Open Source** projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode). It runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

### Install Visual Studio Code

1. **Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download?WT.mc_id=iot-0000-dglover)**

#### Visual Studio Code Extensions

The features that Visual Studio Code includes out-of-the-box are just the start. VS Code extensions let you add languages, debuggers, and tools to your installation to support your development workflow.

#### Browse for extensions

You can search and install extensions from within Visual Studio Code. Open the Extensions view from the Visual Studio Code main menu, select **View** > **Extensions** or by clicking on the Extensions icon in the **Activity Bar** on the side of Visual Studio Code.

![Extensions view icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gloveboxes/PyLab-2-Python-Azure-IoT-Central-and-Docker-Container-Debugging/master/resources/extensions-view-icon.png)

This will show you a list of the most popular VS Code extensions on the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/VSCode?WT.mc_id=iot-0000-dglover).

<!-- ![popular extensions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gloveboxes/PyLab-2-Python-Azure-IoT-Central-and-Docker-Container-Debugging/master/resources/extensions-popular.png) -->

![vs code install extension](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gloveboxes/PyLab-2-Python-Azure-IoT-Central-and-Docker-Container-Debugging/master/resources/vs-code-install-extension.png)

![Device Connection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gloveboxes/PyLab-2-Python-Azure-IoT-Central-and-Docker-Container-Debugging/master/resources/iot-central-device-connection.png)


## Configure the Python Application

1. Switch back to Visual Studio Code. Open the **env-file** (environment file). This file contains environment variables that will be passed to the Docker container.

2. Paste the Scope ID, Device ID, and Primary Key into the env-file.

    For example (don't try to use the sample values in the example as they will not work):

    ```text
    SCOPE=0ne00012345
    DEVICE_ID=rpi-device
    KEY=dB0g7hikas9isvYfYkqCofRpFl7VoXCGuuNOvCa1aK8=
    ```

3. Save the env-file file (Ctrl+S)

<!-- 4. Ensure **Explorer** selected in the activity bar, right mouse click file named **Dockerfile** and select **Build Image**.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gloveboxes/PyLab-2-Python-Azure-IoT-Central-and-Docker-Container-Debugging/master/resources/vs-code-docker-build.png)

5. Give your docker build image a **unique name** - eg the first part of your email address, your nickname, something memorable, followed by **:latest**. The name needs to be unique otherwise it will clash with others building Docker images on the same Raspberry Pi.

    For example **glovebox:latest**

![docker base image name](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gloveboxes/PyLab-2-Python-Azure-IoT-Central-and-Docker-Container-Debugging/master/resources/docker-build-name.png) -->

### How Debugging a Python App in a Docker Container Works

- Each User Profile (**\$USER**) has a Unique (**\$LAB_PORT**) Environment Variable that is set when you log into the Raspberry Pi (.bashrc).
- The follow happens when you start a Visual Studio Code Docker container debug session:

    1. A Docker container named \$USER is built to include your Python Code (docker build)
    2. Docker maps \$LAB_PORT to Port 3000 in the container (-p \$LAB_PORT:3000).
    If you review the **.vscode/task.json** file you will see the Docker commands that run when you start the debugger.
    3. The Docker Container is started (docker run –p \$LAB_PORT:3000)
    4. One of the first lines of code in the **app.py** file is to start the _ptvsd_ (Python Tools for Visual Studio Debugger) debugger to listen on port 3000.

        ```python
        ptvsd.enable_attach(address=('0.0.0.0', 3000))
        ```

    5. Next the Visual Studio Code debugger attaches to \$LAB_PORT that is mapped through to port 3000. This is the port that the Visual Studio Python Debugger is listening on in the container. Review the **.vscode/launch.json** file to understand how the debugger attach works.
    6. Now you can start stepping through the Python code, set breakpoints, inspect variables etc.

    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gloveboxes/PyLab-2-Python-Azure-IoT-Central-and-Docker-Container-Debugging/master/resources/docker-debugging.png)

### Build and Run the Docker Image

Press **F5** to start debugging the Python application. The process will first build and then start the Docker Container. When the Docker Container has started the Visual Studio Code Debugger will attach to the running application.

There are two configuration files found in the .vscode folder that are responsible for running and debugging the Python application. You can find more detail the [Debugger Configuration](#debugger-configuration) appendix.

## Set a Visual Studio Debugger Breakpoint

1. From **Explorer** on the Visual Studio Code activity bar, open the **app.py** file
1. Set a breakpoint at line 66, **temperature, pressure, humidity, timestamp = mysensor.measure()** in the **publish** function.

    - You can set a breakpoint by doing any one of the following:

        - With the cursor on that line, press F9, or,
        - With the cursor on that line, select the Debug > Toggle Breakpoint menu command, or, click directly in the margin to the left of the line number (a faded red dot appears when hovering there). The breakpoint appears as a red dot in the left margin:

    ![Attached debugger](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gloveboxes/PyLab-2-Python-Azure-IoT-Central-and-Docker-Container-Debugging/master/resources/vs-code-set-breakpoint.png)

### Debug actions

Once a debug session starts, the **Debug toolbar** will appear at the top of the editor window.

![Debug Actions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gloveboxes/PyLab-2-Python-Azure-IoT-Central-and-Docker-Container-Debugging/master/resources/toolbar.png)

The debugger toolbar (shown above) will appear in Visual Studio Code. It has the following options:

1. Pause (or Continue, F5),
2. Step Over (F10)
3. Step Into (F11),
4. Step Out (Shift+F11),
5. Restart (Ctrl+Shift+F5),
6. and Stop (Shift+F5).

### Step through the Python code

1. Press **F10**, or from the Debugger Toolbar, click **Step Over** until you are past the **print(telemetry)** line of code.
2. Explore the **Variable Window** (Ctrl+Shift+Y). Try changing variable values.
3. Explore the **Debug Console**. You will see sensor telemetry and the results of sending the telemetry to Azure IoT Central.
    ![vs code debug console](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gloveboxes/PyLab-2-Python-Azure-IoT-Central-and-Docker-Container-Debugging/master/resources/vs-code-debug-console.png)
4. From the **Debug** Menu -> **Disable All Breakpoints**
5. Press **F5** or from the Debugger Toolbar, click **Continue** so the Python application runs and streams telemetry to **Azure IoT Central**.

## Exploring Device Telemetry in Azure IoT Central

1. Use **Device** to navigate to the **Measurements** page for the real Raspberry Pi device you added:

    ![Navigate to real device](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gloveboxes/PyLab-2-Python-Azure-IoT-Central-and-Docker-Container-Debugging/master/resources/iot-central-select-device.png)

1. On the **Measurements** page, you can see the telemetry streaming from the Raspberry Pi device:

    ![View telemetry from real device](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gloveboxes/PyLab-2-Python-Azure-IoT-Central-and-Docker-Container-Debugging/master/resources/iot-central-view-telemetry.png)

#### Take a tour of the Azure IoT Central UI

This article introduces you to the Microsoft Azure IoT Central UI. You can use the UI to create, manage, and use an Azure IoT Central solution and its connected devices.

As a _builder_, you use the Azure IoT Central UI to define your Azure IoT Central solution. You can use the UI to:

- Define the types of device that connect to your solution.
- Configure the rules and actions for your devices.
- Customize the UI for an _operator_ who uses your solution.

As an _operator_, you use the Azure IoT Central UI to manage your Azure IoT Central solution. You can use the UI to:

- Monitor your devices.
- Configure your devices.
- Troubleshoot and remediate issues with your devices.
- Provision new devices.

#### Use the left navigation menu

Use the left navigation menu to access the different areas of the application. You can expand or collapse the navigation bar by selecting **<** or **>**:

#### Dashboard

![Dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gloveboxes/PyLab-2-Python-Azure-IoT-Central-and-Docker-Container-Debugging/master/media/overview-iot-central-tour/homepage.png)

The dashboard is the first page you see when you sign in to your Azure IoT Central application. As a builder, you can customize the application dashboard for other users by adding tiles. To learn more, see the [Customize the Azure IoT Central operator's view](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-central/tutorial-customize-operator?WT.mc_id=iot-0000-dglover) tutorial. Users can also [create their own personal dashboards](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-central/howto-personalize-dashboard?WT.mc_id=iot-0000-dglover).

#### Device explorer

![Explorer page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gloveboxes/PyLab-2-Python-Azure-IoT-Central-and-Docker-Container-Debugging/master/media/overview-iot-central-tour/explorer.png)

The explorer page shows the _devices_ in your Azure IoT Central application grouped by _device template_.

* A device template defines a type of device that can connect to your application. To learn more, see the [Define a new device type in your Azure IoT Central application](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-central/tutorial-define-device-type?WT.mc_id=iot-0000-dglover).
* A device represents either a real or simulated device in your application. To learn more, see the [Add a new device to your Azure IoT Central application](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-central/tutorial-add-device?WT.mc_id=iot-0000-dglover).

#### Device sets

![Device Sets page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gloveboxes/PyLab-2-Python-Azure-IoT-Central-and-Docker-Container-Debugging/master/media/overview-iot-central-tour/devicesets.png)

The _device sets_ page shows device sets created by the builder. A device set is a collection of related devices. A builder defines a query to identify the devices that are included in a device set. You use device sets when you customize the analytics in your application. To learn more, see the [Use device sets in your Azure IoT Central application](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-central/howto-use-device-sets?WT.mc_id=iot-0000-dglover) article.

#### Device Templates

![Device Templates page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gloveboxes/PyLab-2-Python-Azure-IoT-Central-and-Docker-Container-Debugging/master/media/overview-iot-central-tour/templates.png)

The device templates page is where a builder creates and manages the device templates in the application. To learn more, see the [Define a new device type in your Azure IoT Central application](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-central/tutorial-define-device-type?WT.mc_id=iot-0000-dglover) tutorial.

#### Analytics

![Analytics page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gloveboxes/PyLab-2-Python-Azure-IoT-Central-and-Docker-Container-Debugging/master/media/overview-iot-central-tour/analytics.png)

The analytics page shows charts that help you understand how the devices connected to your application are behaving. An operator uses this page to monitor and investigate issues with connected devices. The builder can define the charts shown on this page. To learn more, see the [Create custom analytics for your Azure IoT Central application](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-central/howto-use-device-sets?WT.mc_id=iot-0000-dglover) article.

#### Jobs

![Jobs page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gloveboxes/PyLab-2-Python-Azure-IoT-Central-and-Docker-Container-Debugging/master/media/overview-iot-central-tour/jobs.png)

The jobs page allows you to perform bulk device management operations onto your devices. The builder uses this page to update device properties, settings, and commands. To learn more, see the [Run a job](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-central/howto-run-a-job?WT.mc_id=iot-0000-dglover) article.

#### Continuous Data Export

![Continuous Data Export page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gloveboxes/PyLab-2-Python-Azure-IoT-Central-and-Docker-Container-Debugging/master/media/overview-iot-central-tour/export.png)

The continuous data export page is where an administrator defines how to export data, such as telemetry, from the application. Other services can store the exported data or use it for analysis. To learn more, see the [Export your data in Azure IoT Central](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-central/howto-export-data?WT.mc_id=iot-0000-dglover) article.
